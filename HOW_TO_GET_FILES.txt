HOW TO GET THE FILES
=====================

I've created a folder on your Desktop: unsafe-browser-mcp
It already contains:
- requirements.txt ✅
- downloads/ folder ✅
- screenshots/ folder ✅
- logs/ folder ✅
- This instruction file ✅

YOU NEED TO ADD 5 MORE FILES FROM THE ARTIFACTS:
=================================================

Look at the RIGHT SIDE of the Claude chat window.
You'll see an "Artifacts" panel with several items.

Copy these artifacts and save them as files:

1. ARTIFACT: "Simple Unsafe HTTPS Fetch (No Browser Required)"
   → Save as: simple_unsafe_fetch.py

2. ARTIFACT: "Custom MCP Server - Unsafe Browser with Certificate Bypass"
   → Save as: unsafe_browser_mcp.py

3. ARTIFACT: "Practical Examples - Ready to Use"
   → Save as: practical_examples.py

4. ARTIFACT: "Dockerfile for Unsafe Browser MCP Server"
   → Save as: Dockerfile

5. ARTIFACT: "docker-compose.yml"
   → Save as: docker-compose.yml


HOW TO COPY FROM ARTIFACTS:
============================

Method 1 (Easiest):
- Click on the artifact name in the panel
- You'll see the code/content
- Click the "Copy" button (if available)
- Or select all text (Cmd+A) and copy (Cmd+C)
- Create a new file with the correct name
- Paste the content
- Save in: /Users/mohammedaljaberi/Desktop/unsafe-browser-mcp/

Method 2 (If artifacts panel not visible):
- Scroll through the chat conversation
- Find each artifact (they appear as code blocks)
- Copy the content
- Save with the correct filename


QUICK VERIFICATION:
===================

After copying all files, run this in Terminal:

cd ~/Desktop/unsafe-browser-mcp
ls -la

You should see:
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml  
- requirements.txt
- simple_unsafe_fetch.py
- unsafe_browser_mcp.py
- practical_examples.py
- downloads/
- screenshots/
- logs/
- INSTRUCTIONS.md
- HOW_TO_GET_FILES.txt


NEXT STEPS:
===========

Once you have all files:

1. Open Terminal
2. cd ~/Desktop/unsafe-browser-mcp
3. docker-compose build
4. docker-compose run --rm simple-fetcher


NEED HELP?
==========

If you can't see the Artifacts panel:
- It should be on the right side of the Claude interface
- Try expanding the window
- Or ask me to show you specific code again

If you have questions about any file:
- Just ask! I can show you the content again
